 Setup Instructions

 Backend (Node.js)

1. Go to backend directory:
   ```
   cd backend
   ```
Install dependencies:
```
npm install
```
Add a .env file:

env contains
```
TWILIO_ACCOUNT_SID=your_twilio_sid
TWILIO_AUTH_TOKEN=your_twilio_token
TWILIO_PHONE_NUMBER=whatsapp:+14155238886
MONGO_URI=your_mongodb_connection_string
```
Start backend:
```
node server.js
```
Server will run on http://localhost:5000

Frontend (Flutter)
Navigate to Flutter app:

```
cd flutter_app
```
Install packages:
```
flutter pub get
```
Add custom font & background image:

```
assets/fonts/Poppins-Regular.ttf

assets/images/bg.jpg
```

Run app (Chrome or emulator):
```
flutter run -d chrome
```
How It Works
1. User Enters Phone Number
Flutter UI collects phone number and calls the backend via /send-otp.

2.  Backend Generates OTP
Random OTP is generated and stored temporarily in memory.

Twilio API sends OTP to user via WhatsApp.


3.  User Enters OTP
OTP is verified on /verify-otp.

If correct → check user in DB:

✅ Exists → return user info

❌ Not found → redirect to registration form

4. New User Registration
Name and email fields are submitted via /register.



5. Home Screen
After login or registration, user is navigated to HomeScreen.

 Security Notes
OTPs are stored in memory for demo. Use Redis or cache with expiry in production.

.env file is used to secure credentials.

HTTPS + rate limiting is recommended in production.

##  Twilio Free Trial Limitations

If you're using a **Twilio Free Trial account**, you should be aware of the following restrictions:

-  You can **only send messages to verified phone numbers** added in your Twilio console.
-  You **cannot send OTPs to arbitrary/unverified numbers** until you upgrade your account.
-  The WhatsApp message will be prefixed with “Sent from your Twilio trial account”.
-  The free trial includes **$15.50 USD credit**, which is sufficient for limited testing.

###  How to Verify Numbers on Free Tier:

1. Go to your Twilio Console → [Verified Caller IDs](https://console.twilio.com/us1/develop/verified-numbers/verified-caller-ids)
2. Click **“Add a new Verified Caller ID”**
3. Enter the phone number you want to send OTPs to
4. Confirm via SMS/Call

> Once verified, you can test WhatsApp OTP with your own number or teammates'.

### How to Upgrade:

To send WhatsApp messages to anyone (not just verified numbers):

- Add payment method and upgrade your Twilio account.
- Enable the **WhatsApp sender** on your Twilio number.
- Follow Twilio’s [WhatsApp Business API onboarding guide](https://www.twilio.com/docs/whatsapp).
